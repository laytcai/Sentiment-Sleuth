# Sentiment-Sleuth
Scrapes social media to gauge sentiments on user prompted context, powered by LLM technology.

Overview
WebScrape is an application designed to gather general sentiment values from social media comments. This tool allows you to specify a topic and a social media platform to scrape data from, and then delve deeper into the opinions and sentiments expressed by others.

Instructions

1. Install All Required Libraries

2. Run Jupyter Notebook

3. First Input: Enter the Topic
When prompted, enter the topic you want to web scrape about. For example, you might enter "climate change" or "cryptocurrency".

Second Input: Choose Social Media Platform

4. Next, specify the social media platform you want to scrape data from. The application currently supports platforms such as Twitter and Reddit. 

5. After entering the inputs, wait for the WebScrape to finish gathering data. The time taken may vary depending on the volume of data and the specified platform.

6. Once the WebScrape completes, you will be prompted to enter a specific opinion or sentiment you want to explore further. For example, you might enter "positive views on climate change" or "negative sentiments about cryptocurrency".

At the end a paragraph of summarization is generated.
